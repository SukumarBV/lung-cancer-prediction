# Lung Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Lung Cancer Prediction** repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict lung cancer risks. By analyzing patient data that includes features like age, smoking habits, and symptoms, we aim to provide accurate predictions for early diagnosis.

## Project Overview ðŸ“Š

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of an individual developing lung cancer. By examining key patient data points and employing data preprocessing, visualization techniques, and performance evaluation metrics, we can generate reliable predictions crucial for timely medical interventions.
